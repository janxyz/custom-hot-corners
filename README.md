# Attention

This project was not updated in a long time and I decided to archive it. [Custom Hot Corners - Extended](https://github.com/G-dH/custom-hot-corners-extended) is a great alternative.

# Custom Hot Corners

A GNOME Shell Extension for customizable hot corners.

## Installation

Download the extension from the [GNOME extension website](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1362/custom-hot-corners/) or install the
extension from the git repository with the following steps (which
require the GNU Build System):

    autoreconf -i
    ./configure
    make local-install
